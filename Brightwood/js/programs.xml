            <h3>Electrical Technician (Diploma)</h3>
            <h5 class="dark_gray">Kaplan College - Dayton, OH</h5>
            <h4>Electrical Technician (Diploma)</h4>
            <p>Electricity is essential for light, power, air conditioning, refrigeration, and so many of the
                conveniences we take for granted every day. Electrical technicians install, connect, test, and
                maintain electrical systems that bring electricity from power generating plants to our homes,
                offices, schools, and places of business. In our electrical technician diploma program, you could
                acquire the knowledge, technical skills, and work habits you need to start a promising new career
                and become a qualified electrical technician.
            </p>
            <h4>A Hands-On Curriculum</h4>
            <p>Your training will emphasize compliance with National Electrical Codes and Occupational Safety and
                Health Administration (OSHA), as well as provide an overview of the basic fundamentals of
                electricity. In addition, specific electrical technician courses will focus on the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>How to add electrical capacity to meet growth requirements of a building</li>
                <li>Replacement of old systems and how to conduct periodic maintenance and repair of various systems
                    and components
                </li>
                <li>Copper and aluminum cabling</li>
                <li>Residential, commercial, and industrial wiring, layout, motors, and controls</li>
                <li>Service mains and multiphase power</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                With the constant building, restoration, and general maintenance needs in the construction industry,
                there is a need for qualified electricians. If you are looking to position yourself as a candidate
                for these jobs, then you have come to the right place.
            </p>
            <p>
                Electrical technicians generally specialize in construction, maintenance work, or both. Construction
                work provides the knowledge and technical skills such as installing wiring systems in new homes,
                businesses, and factories or rewiring or upgrading existing electrical systems. Maintenance work
                involves maintaining and upgrading existing electrical systems and repairing electrical equipment.
                Nearly two-thirds of electrical technicians are employed in the construction industry and the rest
                work as maintenance electricians in other industries or are self-employed.
            </p>
            <h4>Job Prospects for Electrical Technicians</h4>
            <p>
                Electrical services are required everywhere, so positions in the electrical field exist in all parts
                of the country. Many electrical technicians work as apprentices to gain the experience they need to
                get their careers started. At our school, you will get plenty of hands-on training in our labs,
                which simulate real-world work environments. Earning a diploma can give you the credentials that
                signify to employers that you have the electrical training and skills required to become a qualified
                electrical technician.
